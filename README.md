# eMan Code Review Task - NodeJS + React Developer

## Introduction

Welcome! This repository contains a simple introductory task designed for the technical interview process at **eMan**
for NodeJS + React developer roles. The main activity revolves around a live code review session.

## Goal

The primary objective of this task is **not** to write extensive code from scratch, but rather to engage in a **live
code review** during the technical interview. We aim to:

* Assess your ability to read, understand, and analyze existing code snippets (one backend with NestJS, one frontend
  with React).
* Discuss the functionality and design choices within the code.
* Identify potential bugs, logical flaws, performance bottlenecks, and areas not adhering to common best practices.
* Talk through potential improvements and alternative approaches.

This exercise helps us understand your thought process, technical communication skills, and foundational knowledge.

## Important Notes

* **Simplified & Intentional:** The code examples provided are deliberately simplified and contain intentional errors or
  suboptimal patterns suitable for discussion at a junior/medior level. Aspects like data fetching implementation,
  database
  interaction, complex state management, full application structure, security hardening, advanced error handling, etc.,
  are **intentionally omitted** to keep the focus on the core review task.
* **Focus on Discussion:** We are more interested in your reasoning and the discussion around the code than finding
  every single minor issue.

## Instructions for the Candidate

1. Please start by opening the `/test` directory.
2. Inside `/test`, you will find the two code files intended for your review:
    * `todo.controller.ts`: A basic NestJS controller managing a simple TODO list.
    * `TodoListComponent.tsx`: A basic React component responsible for displaying a TODO list.
3. Review these files. During the interview, we will go through them together. Be prepared to:
    * Explain what the code does.
    * Point out any issues you find (bugs, design flaws, potential performance problems, readability concerns, etc.).
    * Suggest ways to improve the code or fix the issues.
    * Discuss the underlying concepts in NestJS and React demonstrated (or violated) in the code.
